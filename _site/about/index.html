        <h1>About</h1>
<p>Sheridan is a software engineer and product manager, working to fight the climate crisis both in her day job and as a Masters student at the Autononmous University of Barcelona's Degrowth Institute.</p>
<p>Previously she has worked in the tech industry for close to 15 years, at large companies like Google and Snap and startups like Canary and Taptap Send. She's been a union organiser at Glitch, and spends her spare time doing yoga, taking long train rides, somewhat reluctantly following a couch-to-5k running program and participating in all forms of singing (from karaoke to amateur musicals).</p>
<p>Sheridan holds a Masters of Engineering from the University of Cambridge (with one year spent studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science abroad at MIT). She is a dual British-American citizen, having grown up near Salisbury in the UK, but has now spent half her life in the US, mostly in New York City. She currently lives in London.</p>
