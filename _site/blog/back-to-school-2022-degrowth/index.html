  <h1>Back to school in 2022</h1>
<p>So I have news: I'm starting a <a href="https://master.degrowth.org/online-masters/">part-time masters on Degrowth</a> this month! It's fully online, run by the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and this is the first year that it's happening. The teachers are some of the most well-regarded experts in the Degrowth field, so I'm really excited to learn from them. By way of some background on why I decided to do this, here's my motivation letter that I sent through, which got me into this program.</p>
<hr>
<p>I can’t really pinpoint the moment at which I became convinced that the current economic system we live in wasn’t working, but I know I began to realise things were extremely wrong during my time working at Google, from 2007-2014. Working there was a front-seat view into exactly how unequal the world was becoming - for example, any neighbourhood in which a new Google office was opening soon took a hit to its local businesses, because inside that building there were cafes and restaurants serving employees with free gourmet meals three times a day, barista-prepared coffees, hairdressers, doctors, and virtually no reason to step outside those walls. Later in my time there they announced death benefits unlike anything I’d ever heard of - if a Google employee passed away, their spouse could expect to continue receiving half their salary for the following 10 years, and their children $1000 per month until they turned 21.</p>
<p>I was a Product Manager on the Ads team, so it was my job to help fuel the money printing machine first-hand. We had to push for quarterly targets of 5% improvements in ads revenues, despite the fact that we were already making so much money, and over time it became apparent to me that the lofty goals with which Google launched itself onto the stock market were being eroded away to achieve those growth targets. In the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2004-ipo-letter/">IPO letter</a>, they called out “We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly.” However it’s clear that over the 15 years following that, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332">those ads have become less and less differentiated from search results</a> (to the point where they’ve been <a href="https://searchengineland.com/ftc-search-engine-disclosure-164722">called out by regulators</a>, to no avail), because they needed to chase that quarterly growth.</p>
<p>Google’s unprecedented wealth trajectory had created a lavish welfare state, but only for the lucky tens of thousands who got to work there - which even excluded the army of contractors that made this adult playground possible, but who had virtually none of the benefits themselves. And of course the employees tended to be white and male, but the contractors were overwhelmingly from marginalised groups, and often overseas (like content reviewers having to look at non-stop harrowing scenes in places like the Philippines).</p>
<p>In 2017 I came across the concept of building an economy that didn’t rely on growth via Kate Raworth’s excellent book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29214420-doughnut-economics">Doughnut Economics</a>. Her clear points about how compound growth was not a concept found in nature (other than within destructive forces like cancer) really opened my eyes to how our current systems were intrinsically set up to require something that was destroying our planet. As I’ve read more, I’ve grown to understand how everything is connected to this capitalist system, from the Enclosures movement forcing people off their land and into selling their labour to survive and allow others to accumulate wealth, to the invention of race to dehumanise Black and Brown people so that their lives could be enslaved to further capital’s needs all over the world.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve moved away from big tech into smaller companies, and have tried to effect change at my places of work - such as being part of the organising and bargaining committees for one of the US tech industry’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307671/glitch-workers-sign-historic-collective-bargaining-agreement-cwa">first successfully-negotiated union contracts</a>. However, I have started to grow disillusioned by the prospect of changing this system from within the companies currently operating within it - especially those who have taken venture capital funding and are essentially tying themselves to the promise of future growth.</p>
<p>Last year I decided that from now on, I would only work for companies working on the climate crisis and/or social inequalities in some real way. But even in my current job in which we’re working on Demand Response and Distributed Energy Resources for the electrical grid, I’m extremely worried about what I see regarding the wider societal pressures around us. The renewable energy sources that we’re helping to make viable are not taking the place of the fossil fuel plants, they’re fulfilling the additional demand that’s growing every year on top of the huge energy needs of the existing system. Without systemic change, I don’t see how we’ll stop renewable energy demand becoming another destructive force on the planet, stripping countries of minerals such as lithium and cobalt and fuelling the next resource conflicts.</p>
<p>I’m now convinced that I need to look outside of existing companies in this system, and learn more about the systemic pressures we can apply in order to change the trajectory that our society is on. I’m extremely grateful for what I’ve learned in my career so far, particularly around how a little technology can help organise people, whether that’s something as simple as a shared document for collaborative note taking and logging of action items for follow up, but I know that technology alone will not solve the problems we’re facing, and that only mass mobilisation of workers can get us there.</p>
<p>I’m not yet sure whether I would do this Master’s course part-time or full-time, so I hope it’s ok to leave that open for now, but I’m extremely excited to learn from these incredible experts in such an important field. In terms of how I’d like to use what I learn in this course, I’m primarily motivated by meeting and talking with others interested in this subject, so we can continue to build on the movement started by so many great thinkers.</p>
<p>Additionally I’d like to think about how we can communicate the messages of Degrowth more widely, and in a way that doesn’t scare people into thinking this is the same thing as austerity. I’d like to be part of challenging mainstream journalism’s incessant personal responsibility propaganda, by contributing to and supporting alternative media highlighting the failing of our economy as a whole. And ultimately I would see myself moving into some kind of policy or government field, or perhaps into founding an alternatively-managed, climate-focused company with a co-operative or stewardship model.</p>
