# About

Sheridan is a software engineer and product manager, working to fight the climate crisis both in her day job and as a Masters student at the Autonomous University of Barcelona's Degrowth Institute.

Previously she has worked in the tech industry for close to 15 years, mostly in NYC, at large companies like Google and Snap and startups like Canary and Taptap Send. She's been a union organiser at Glitch, and spends her spare time doing yoga, taking long train rides, somewhat reluctantly following a couch-to-5k running program and participating in all forms of singing (from karaoke to amateur musicals).

Sheridan holds a Masters of Engineering from the University of Cambridge (with one year spent studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science abroad at MIT). She currently lives in London.
