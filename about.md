# About

Sheridan is a software engineer and product manager, working to fight the climate crisis both in her day job and as a Masters student at the Autononmous University of Barcelona's Degrowth Institute.

Previously she has worked in the tech industry for close to 15 years, at large companies like Google and Snap and startups like Canary and Taptap Send. She's been a union organiser at Glitch, and spends her spare time doing yoga, taking long train rides, somewhat reluctantly following a couch-to-5k running program and participating in all forms of singing (from karaoke to amateur musicals).

Sheridan holds a Masters of Engineering from the University of Cambridge (with one year spent studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science abroad at MIT). She is a dual British-American citizen, having grown up near Salisbury in the UK, but has now spent half her life in the US, mostly in New York City. She currently lives in London.
